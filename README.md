### Insert metrics from Facebook, Twitter and Analytics into a Google Spreadsheet ###

Metrics:
 * Facebook likes (in any Social Graph object that you specify)
 * Twitter followers count
 * Twitter following count
 * Google Analytics total visits for the past day
 * Google Analytics total pageviews for the past day

You may want to launch this script with a [time-based trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_triggers?hl=es#TimeTriggers). If so, you must run it manually for the first time to authorize the Twitter API consumer if you didn't.

For Analytics, you have to enable the Analytics API in the script. [Instructions here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/articles/reporting-apps-script#enable).
